                                                amount of data that is available today. With the increase in data
                                                availability, it has become essential to develop automated algorithms
                                                that can learn from the data and make predictions or decisions without
                                                human intervention.</p>
                                            <p>Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that uses
                                                statistical models and algorithms to enable computers to learn from data
                                                and improve their performance over time. Data mining, on the other hand,
                                                is the process of extracting useful information from large datasets.</p>

                                            <p>Overfitting occurs when a model is too complex and learns the noise in

                                                "folds." It works by training the model on a portion of the data and
                                                testing it on the remaining data. This process is repeated multiple

                                                learning models by adding a penalty term to the loss function. This
                                                penalty term discourages the model from learning complex patterns in the

                                            <p>Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to find the optimal
                                                values of the parameters in a machine learning model. It works by
                                                iteratively updating the parameters in the direction of the negative
                                                gradient of the loss function. This process continues until the

                                                descent is a key component of many machine learning algorithms,

                                            <p>A decision tree is a tree-like model that uses a set of rules to classify
                                                or predict outcomes. Each node in the tree represents a decision point,
                                                and each branch represents the possible outcomes of that decision. In
                                                contrast, a random forest is an ensemble model that combines multiple
