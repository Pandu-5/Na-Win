                                            <p>By default batch class is stateless (variable value which is stored in
                                                one method cannot be remembered in another method).</p>
                                            <p>To maintain the state for the batch class, we should inherit

                                            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> By default batch class is stateless. Emails
                                                which are added to

                                                set in finish method you won't see those emails. In finish method if you

                                                used is the version of the running batch class that starts or schedules

                                            <p>2. <strong>Purpose:</strong> Assume that, we need to display the user

                                                the below steps to create the wrapper list :</p>
                                            <p>1. Create an Apex Class say 'MyWrapper'(It can be inside/outside of the

                                                2. Declare the necessary variables in the class to store the
                                                information.<br>
                                                3. Create a list called 'MyWrapList' for 'MyWrapper'.<br>
                                                4. Create multiple instances for 'MyWrapper' and store it in
                                                'MyWrapList' list.<br>
                                                5. Access 'MyWrapList' list from VF page.</p>

                                                1. If you want to display checkboxes along with records so that upon
                                                selecting checkboxes corresponding records can be processed (Updating,

                                                * Validation Rules and Formula fields
                                                * Apex Classes and Apex Triggers
                                                * Visualforce Pages</p>
                                            <p>What is the advantage?</p>
                                            <p>* Assume that you are referring a Record Type Name multiple times in an
                                                apex class, in future if the client asked to rename the record type then
                                                in all the palaces we need change by searching which consume good amount
                                                of time. To avoid that if you store the Record Type Name in custom label
                                                and refer that custom label in all the places. If you need to change the
                                                name in future then you need to change only in that custom label. <br>
                                                * Assume that you are displaying an error message on the visualforce
                                                page, in future if the client asked to change the error message then it
                                                will be a code change. For code change it requires lot of approvals from
                                                business which consume lot of time. If you keep the error message in a
                                                custom label and refer on the page, in future it won't be a code change,
                                                in production directly they can replace the error message in that custom
                                                label.</p>

                                                2. We can create the fields and we can store the records.<br>
                                                3. List Custom Settings records will store in Application Cache
                                                memory.<br>
                                                4. To access List Custom Settings records no need to use SOQL query.<br>
                                                5. Example: Based on the regions, zip codes should be retrieved. In this
                                                case, If you store these records in a custom object every time we need
                                                to query from the database. Instead if you store the records in List
                                                Custom Settings, without consuming SOQL query we can capture the
                                                information from the database.</p>

                                                1. We can add users and profiles.<br>
                                                2. After that we can check that a particular/current logged in user is

                                                pageReference we can append parameters. See the below example -

                                                In this case no need to pass the parameters from one page to other to

                                                we should pass teh parameters.
